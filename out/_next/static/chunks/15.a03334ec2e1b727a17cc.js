Today i am going to show you how to install \r\nVSCode on android. If you read my [previous post](https://dev.to/josiasaurel/how-to-install-vscode-on-android-5f8d),\r\nyou probably have it working. In this new post i am going to\r\nshow you how to install VSCode without having to install a \r\nlinux distro in termux. We are going to use barebones termux\r\nand some additional packages.\r\n\r\nLet's Start\r\n\r\nFirst thing is to install [termux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux)\r\n\r\nOnce you have that installed, we can proceed to the next steps\r\n\r\nInstall NodeJS in termux with the following command\r\n```shell\r\n$ pkg install nodejs\r\n```\r\n\r\nTermux is going to install NodeJS and npm. If any question is asked during the installation, accept it.\r\n\r\nNext we are going to install [yarn pkg](https://yarnpkg.com/) and then use it to install code-server\r\n\r\nRun the below commands\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ npm i -g yarn\r\n```\r\nThe above will install yarn\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ yarn global add code-server\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above command will install code-server globally in your system.\r\n\r\nNow you may ask why we did not directly use ``` npm ``` to install code-server\r\nThe reason is i have encoutered issues when installing it through npm, in fact, it did mot work at all.\r\n\r\nIf you have gone through the above steps, you can now launch ``` code-server ``` anywhere in your terminal by typing\r\n```shell\r\n$ code-server\r\n```\r\nIt will launch and give you a link you can open in your browser. You can optionally add it to your home screen if you are using chrome.\r\n\r\nEach time you launch it, you'll be asked for a password which is found in a config file in termux ``` HOME ```\r\n\r\n"}}]);
